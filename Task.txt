AI Engineering Home Task – Alex AI / VICI Integration
Business Case
A healthcare retailer provides premium eyewear for colorblind Medicare members under a
subscription-based program. Incoming callers are verified through an initial screening
(name and city) before being handed over to an AI calling agent. The AI agent gets the phone
number and name of this member (live from the Phone system) combined with the member
demographics information from this retailer CRM and needs to cross-checks the caller’s
Medicare plan level and eligibility (another external non-crm system) combining real-time
conversation data with the member information already on file to determine qualification for
the premium subscription and next-step fulfillment.
The final outcome needs to be sent into this retailer CRM system.
Objective
Create a working VAPI assistant capable of dealing with this situation.
Demonstrate your flow for AI agent integrations with a legacy dialer (VICI) to manage inbound
call workflows using Twilio/VAPI for live conversations and API feedback loops for call
dispositions, data retrieval, and lead routing.

Instructions
1. System Understanding
● Review the provided “Alex AI / VICI Integration” diagram.
● Write a short technical summary explaining the system’s end-to-end logic — from VICI
initiating an outbound call to the AI agent completing or dispositioning it.
● Identify each integration layer (e.g., telephony, AI logic, CRM, data services) and its
purpose.

2. Flow Analysis *2 page PDF 2 Diagram attached
Explain in your own words:
● What triggers each state change (Idle → Pre-Connect → Connected → API Disposition
→ Next Call).

● How you would design the call event listener to detect voicemail, dead air, IVR, or live
person responses.
● Where Twilio/VAPI should handle call media vs. where your backend should handle
conversation state.

3. API & Data Layer Design
Describe how you’d implement:
● API requests between the AI agent and VICI for call dispositions (SALE, NQI, NA, etc.).
● Validation workflows (SSN → MBI → Insurance Check).
● Error-handling logic for retries, invalid data, or unexpected responses.
● Data persistence model (what data is stored, where, and why).

4. Conversational Intelligence
Outline how the AI agent should:
● Detect and adapt to voicemail, beeps, busy tones, or custom greetings.
● Determine whether a conversation is a “Live Contact” or “Not Interested” scenario.
● Manage interruptions, re-prompts, or handovers to a human agent.

5. Scalability & Reliability
Propose your approach for:
● Scaling to 100+ concurrent calls using Twilio SIP or WebRTC connections.
● Monitoring performance (call latency, dropped calls, success ratios).
● Handling agent hours (9:00am–5:45pm EST) and after-hours call-back scheduling.

6. Implementation Sketch
Optionally, include:
● Pseudocode or API sequence diagram showing the interaction between
VICI ↔ AI Agent ↔ CRM ↔ Twilio/VAPI.

● How you’d test this system locally (mock APIs, simulated Twilio calls, etc.).

Deliverable
1 - Inbound Phone Number capable of covering this scenario.
2 - A minimal written document or notebook covering the six sections above (Focus on clarity
of architecture, reasoning, and decision trade-offs — not production-level code)
